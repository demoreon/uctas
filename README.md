The Ultimate Crypto Trading Analysis Suite is a comprehensive and robust TradingView indicator built on TradingView that combines multiple technical indicators to provide traders with powerful insights into the behavior of specific cryptocurrencies.

This advanced suite incorporates Bollinger Bands, spread analysis across three Bollinger Bands, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) across multiple timeframes.

Additionally, it offers enhanced color-coded visualization, user-defined parameters, an alert system, multi-time frame analysis, and a user-friendly interface. By integrating these features, traders can make informed decisions and optimize their trading strategies.

## Technologies Used
- Pine Script: The primary scripting language used within the TradingView platform for developing custom indicators and trading strategies.

## Installation
To utilize the Crypto Trading Analysis Suite, follow these steps:

1. Open the TradingView platform.
2. Create a new Pine Script indicator.
3. Copy and paste the provided code snippet into the Pine Script editor.
4. Customize the parameters based on your preferences.
5. Save and apply the indicator to your desired cryptocurrency chart.

## Code Snippet
```pine
//@version=5
indicator("Custom Bollinger Bands", overlay=true)

length = input(20, "Bollinger Bands Length")
stdDev = input(2, "Standard Deviation")
src = close

basis = ta.sma(src, length)
dev = ta.stdev(src, length)

upper = basis + dev * stdDev
lower = basis - dev * stdDev

plot(upper, color=color.blue, title="Upper Band")
plot(lower, color=color.red, title="Lower Band")
```

## Algorithm

The algorithm for the Custom Bollinger Bands indicator implemented in this project is as follows:

1. Set the length parameter to define the number of periods used for calculating the moving average and standard deviation.
2. Set the standard deviation parameter to determine the number of standard deviations away from the moving average the upper and lower bands should be.
3. Calculate the moving average (basis) using the simple moving average function.
4. Calculate the standard deviation (dev) using the standard deviation function.
5. Calculate the upper band by adding the standard deviation multiplied by the standard deviation parameter to the moving average.
6. Calculate the lower band by subtracting the standard deviation multiplied by the standard deviation parameter from the moving average.
7. Plot the upper and lower bands on the chart.
